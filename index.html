Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists. Built-in languages include C,[9] C++, C++/CLI, Visual Basic .NET, C#, F#,[10] JavaScript, TypeScript, XML, XSLT, HTML, and CSS. Support for other languages such as Python,[11] Ruby, Node.js, and M among others is available via plug-ins. Java (and J#) were supported in the past.</p>
